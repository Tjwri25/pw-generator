# Password Generator

In this assignment, I created a random password generator. This allows the user to choose what criteria they would like included in their random password. 

They can choose: 
  * How many characters (between 8 and 128)
  * If they would like to include uppercase or lowercase letters, or both.
  * If they would like to include numbers. 
  * If they would like to include special characters. 

If they do not wish to add one of these, they have the option to click the cancel button, and it will not include that specific criteria. 

If they do not choose the minimum criteria, they will get an alert that they have to choose at least one, and it will return to the beginning and they will have to choose again.
